This is just a placeholder website currently, but I intend to use it for my personal profile, technical notes and ideas, and as a fitness activity log.

I am intending to follow the [indieweb](https://indieweb.org/) approach as much as possible and also syndicate with my [social media presence](https://social.gilespaterson.com/@giles) on the fediverse.

I've also got an idea for a self hosted strava-like/lite so I can record and display my running and cycling activities.
